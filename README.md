## NC News Frontend

Welcome to the NC News Frontend project! This project is the frontend of a news aggregation application built with React. It interacts with a RESTful API to display articles, topics, and user comments dynamically, providing a Reddit-like experience for users.

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by Northcoders: https://northcoders.com/

### Project Summary

NC News Frontend is a responsive web application that displays articles on various topics such as football, coding, and cooking. Users can browse articles, view comments, and interact with content. The app is built with React and uses Swiper.js for interactive sliders, with React Router for client-side routing.
Key Features

Display articles: View a list of articles for different topics or a single article by its ID.
Interactive sliders: Browse through topics using a smooth, autoplay-enabled slider.
Client-side routing: Navigate through different sections of the app without page reloads.
Responsive design: The app adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
